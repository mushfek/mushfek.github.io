<h5><u>Abstract</u></h5>
Understanding user activity and site usage pattern is a very important for the system designers and developers not only for optimisation but also to ensure better user experience. 
In a large system this becomes even more important and gradually built-up systems may lose this focus. 
Hence, a system which can recognise and group common and effective usage pattern is a very useful tool and might improve the product in general.
