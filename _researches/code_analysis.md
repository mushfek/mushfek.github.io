title: Web Application Security and Code Quality Analysis with Static Code Analyzers
index: 3
description: Used multiple open source and proprietary static code analysis tools (Sonarqube, Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs) on the full codebase of multiple platforms (Web, Android, iOS) to detect potential vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 Security Vulnerabilities). Later fixed those findings using 80-20 rule which fixed more than 95% of the reported issues.
