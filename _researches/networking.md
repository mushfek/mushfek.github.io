title: Performance Comparison of AODV and DSDV Routing Protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) using NS2
index: 6
description: There are various routing protocols available for MANETs. The most popular ones are DSR, AODV and DSDV. In this project, I simulated two routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networksâ€“ the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) and the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing (AODV) and evaluated both protocols based on packet delivery fraction and throughput  while varying number of sources and pause time.
