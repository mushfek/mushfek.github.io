This application was developed in National Hackathon 2014 to solve one of the most pervasive national problems, Sexual Harassment.

The application has multiple modules:
1. Anonymous Authenticated Identification System
An authentication/identification system so reporter will be anonymous in the network & communication but higher applicable authority will able to know her identity so can provide support.
2. Report crime (to applicable higher authority)
This is a simple message-based system where women can report a crime / harassment she experienced to the applicable authority.
3. Crowd sourced Heatmap/Area reporting
In a map, one can point a location where she were victim of eve-teasing or harassment.
4. Ask for Counseling
User can ask for counseling/advice to trained counselor hiding her identity
5. One click Urgent Help
In a vulnerable situation, one can ask for help by clicking a button (call+sms+location information will go directly to preset persons) 
6. Raise Awareness / Share experience through safe & secure network
A community feed where users can discuss between them in various issue / raise awareness against common problems they faced regularly.

My contribution was to develop a social media like awareness portal where users could post and discuss any incident and share knowledge.
