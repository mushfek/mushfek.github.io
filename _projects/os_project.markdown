#### mShell
A sample implementation of Unix shell with its own "cd", "pwd" and "jobs" command. You can see process resource statistics as well.

Source code is available in [Github](https://github.com/mushfek/os-assignments/blob/main/mshell.cpp).

<hr>

#### Unix ls command
Sample file lister for Unix. This does not implement all the functions of standard ls but a reduced set of options that were the requirements for the project. 

Source code is available in [Github](https://github.com/mushfek/os-assignments/blob/main/ls.cpp).
