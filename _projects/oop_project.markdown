Simulation of three very important distributed system algorithms: centralized, election and token ring algorithm. Here the message passing among the hosts of the distributed system is simulated using Java sockets. It can be used as a helpful tool to understand how these algorithms work. It was developed as the course final project of Object Oriented Programming Lab.
