I am a Software Engineer and R&D specialist based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer in the System Architecture Team of BD subsidiary of [Therap Services, LLC](https://www.therapservices.net/), a [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) and [SOC 2<sup>®</sup>](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report.html) complaint industry-leading US-based electronic health records and associated functionality provider platform.
